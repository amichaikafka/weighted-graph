# weighted_graph
* The goal of this program is to implement the data structure undirected and weighted graph.
## The implementation is done by 3 classes that implements 3 interfaces.
1. The class NodInfo implement node_info interface.
2. The class WGraph_DS implement weighted_graph interface.
3. The class WGraph_Algo implement weighted_graph_algorithms interface.

## The main operations that the program supports:
1. Isconected: check if the graph is connected.
2. shortestPathDist: returns the length shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex consider the weight of each edge.
3. shortestPath: returns the shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex consider the weight of each edge.
4. copy: Compute a deep copy of a weighted graph.
