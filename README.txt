The goal of this program is to implement the data structure undirected and weighted graph.
The implementation is done by 3 classes that implements 3 interfaces.
The class NodInfo implement node_info interface.
The class WGraph_DS implement weighted_graph interface.
The class WGraph_Algo implement weighted_graph_algorithms interface.

The main operations that the program supports:
Isconected: check if the graph is connected.
shortestPathDist: returns the length shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex consider the weight of each edge.
shortestPath: returns the shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex consider the weight of each edge.
copy: Compute a deep copy of a weighted graph.
